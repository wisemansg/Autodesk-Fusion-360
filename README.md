# 90° Flanged Elbow — Fusion 360 CAD Model

## Overview
This project models a 90-degree flanged elbow fitting designed in Autodesk Fusion 360. The part demonstrates CAD modeling fundamentals including circular geometry, swept pipe features, hole patterning, and flange assembly preparation.

## Objective
Replicate a flanged elbow pipe component from a provided 2D technical drawing while maintaining dimensional accuracy and manufacturable geometry. This type of component is commonly used for industrial fluid transfer and pneumatic routing.
